The examples provided illustrate how to use PyHSPF and how to think in HSPF. Here is a summary of the examples:

1. Building an HSPF model (hypothetical example with no external data sources)
2. Building and running the Hunting Creek HSPF model with a daily time step consistent with HSPExp
3. Building the Hunting Creek HSPF model with an hourly time step consistent with HSPExp
4. Utilizing the PyHSPF Postprocessor class to analyze the Hunting Creek example
5. Performing a calibration of the Hunting Creek watershed with Python and PyHSPF
6. Utilizing PyHSPF's built-in extractor for Global Historical Climate Network Daily data
7. Repeat of example 1 but illustrating the use of Special Actions

PyHSPF can do way more than this though--I can develop more examples as needed. Just contact me.
