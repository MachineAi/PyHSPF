PyHSPF is in need of further development. The following are specific features that
need to be added. Contact the developers if you have other suggestions or are
interested in contributing to development/extension of these or other applications.

01. Examples of potential evapotranspiration time series development
02. Examples of snow simulations and time series integration
03. Examples of sediment transport simulations
04. Examples of Upper Mississippi HydrologyCalibrator application
05. More Special Actions added to existing functions
06. Additional PyHSPF temperature modules for the HSPFModel and associated classes
07. Additional PyHSPF utility modules to improve memory allocation (COPY)
08. Additional PyHSPF quality modules for the HSPFModel and associated classes
09. Add PyHSPF nitrogen, phosphorous, and pesticide modules
10. Integration with other watershed delineation tools (e.g., TauDEM)
11. Variable land use with time
12. Open Source GIS Integration
