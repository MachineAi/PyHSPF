PyHSPF is in need of further development. This is a list of things that I
want to add. Please contact me if you have other suggestions or are
interested in contributing to the development of these applications.

1.  Examples of GIS data extraction (NHDPlus and NASS CDL)
2.  Examples of snow simulations
3.  Examples of sediment transport simulations
4.  Examples of HydrologyCalibrator application
4.  PyHSPF temperature modules for HSPF operations (PERLND, IMPLND, RCHRES)
5.  HSPF utility operations to improve memory allocation (COPY)
6.  PyHSPF Qualtiy modules for HSPF operations (PERLND, IMPLND, RCHRES)
7.  Auto-calibration routines
8.  PyHSPF nitrogen, phosphorous, and pesticide modules
9.  Integration with watershed delineation tools (e.g., TauDEM)
10. Variable land use modules
