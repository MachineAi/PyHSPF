PyHSPF is in need of further development. The following are specific functions that
need to be added. Please contact the development team if you have other suggestions or are
interested in contributing to the development of these applications.

1.  National Agricultural Statistics Service Cropland Data Layer (CDL) extraction/integration
2.  Examples of potential evapotranspiration time series development
3.  Examples of snow simulations and time series integration
4.  Examples of sediment transport simulations
5.  Examples of Upper Mississippi HydrologyCalibrator application
6.  More Special Actions added to existing functions
7.  Additional PyHSPF temperature modules for the HSPFModel and associated classes
8.  Additional PyHSPF utility modules to improve memory allocation (COPY)
9.  Additional PyHSPF quality modules for the HSPFModel and associated classes
10. Development of more sophisticated auto-calibration routines
11. Add PyHSPF nitrogen, phosphorous, and pesticide modules
12. Integration with watershed delineation tools (e.g., TauDEM)
13. Variable land use with time
14. Open Source GIS Integration
