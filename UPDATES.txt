Version 0.1.0

Initial commit

Version 0.1.1

Added a "day of the water year" plot option
Fixed some issues with the "flow network plot"
Got rid of point shapefiles related to climate data in preprocessor
Fixed solar radiation units for climate plots
Other minor changes mostly regarding comments

Version 0.1.2

Added forecasting module
Fixed some issues with dayofyear for short simulations
Other minor changes mostly regarding comments

Version 0.1.3

Added special actions file and class to easy implementation
Re-organized the core classes for HSPF modules (Perlnd, Implnd, Rchres, SpecialActions) into different files
Re-organized the core classes to increase tranparency of process parameters
Added example7.py to illustrate the use of special actions

Version 0.1.4

Changed directories to one source "src" (trying to use the GitHub version contorl--future release will be "forks").
Modified the setup.py file to remove the download from source, and make directory "misc" that has a file that can compile HSPF (separate from Python) and generate the message file.
Re-organized and updated climate data extraction tools
New example climate data download tools
New tests running existing HSPF UCI files from the main HSPF source code

Version 0.1.5
Removed frivolous area argument to the add_flowplane method in the Subbasin class
Updated examples for consistency with change
NHDPlus data extractor/example

Version 0.1.6
Added source code documentation
Added classes to preprocessing to replace existing functions including:
NHDPlusExtractor -- Downloads source data from NHDPlus website, extracts HUC8 data
NWISExtractor -- Downloads source metadata file and gage data from NWIS
NHDPlusDelineator -- Delineates the watershed for a gage in a HUC8 and builds Watershed
Fixed issue with merge_shapes
Added examples using NWISExtractor, NHDPlusExtractor, NHDPlusDelineator
Separated Flowline class into new file
Some changes to GageStation class for compatibility with NWISExtractor
Some changes to the __init__ files to improve importing

Version 0.1.7
Re-organized preprocessing climateutils routines
Minor import changes
Added AutoCalibrator
Added hunting.py example--comprehensive build of HSPF model including all source data and autocalibration

Version 0.1.8
Added storm plot features to postprocessor
Removed redundant specification of outlets in the Watershed masslink dictionary
Improved NHDPlusExtractor to deal with organization of files on their server
Minor changes to raster processing (error handling)
Updated examples (consistency with changes based on redundancy)
